Open Attributed Graph Grammar System

## History

AGG is a development environment for attributed graph transformation systems supporting an algebraic approach to graph transformation.
It aims at specifying and rapid prototyping applications with complex, graph structured data. AGG may be (re)used (without GUI)
as a general purpose graph transformation engine in high level JAVA applications employing graph transformation methods.

The work on AGG started in the beginning of 1997. The system is developed and managed by Olga Runge (https://www.user.tu-berlin.de/o.runge/AGG/WWW/agg.html) at Technische Universit√§t Berlin (https://www.tu.berlin/).

The Mirror Open AGG is managed by Janusch Rentenatus, providing code review since 2021 and Java upgrades.
